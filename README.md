This is my Activity 8: API that has API endpoint using PHP that shares your MYSQL data from a minimum of two tables. 
This also includes my C# application that can perform GET and POST transactions.
The php api is inside the myapi folder.
My youtube link for demonstrating the system integration: https://youtu.be/a1vPTRYUU9g
